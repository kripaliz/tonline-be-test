## Target Back-end Developer Test

Hi, thank you for applying for the role of back-end developer with Target Australia!

We're really excited to learn about you, including your coding style, your problem solving, and your approach to development.

This test is not intended to take a long time. It is an opportunity for you to show us how you work, what you prioritise and that your skillset is aligned to work with us in our code base.

What we are looking for:

- How you structure your code.
- Coding best practises you follow.
- How well your code is tested / the approach to testing.
- How you document the codebase.
- How you follow code styling conventions.
- It is also recommended to try to setup some Continuous Integration on your repository.

We don't expect everything to be solved entirely - time constraints are there and we know other commitments get in the way. When you are happy with your solution, please fill out any additional details in README.md. You may mention what you would do next, or any things you have purposely omited due to time constraints.

### The problem

Choose from one of the problems under problems directory.

### Your solution

1. Create a GitHub repository to develop the solution.
1. Develop in JavaScript/NodeJS.

### Submitting & building your solution

Make sure the GitHub repo is public and respond to the e-mail with a link to your repo. From there, we'll let you know once we've completed our assessment of your code, and you may delete your repo or make it private.
